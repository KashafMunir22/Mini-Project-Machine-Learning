# 1. INTRODUCTION 
## 1.1. Project Overview:
The Real Estate Price Prediction project aims to develop a system that predicts 
property prices using machine learning techniques. The system takes key parameters such 
as property type, location, city, purpose (sale or rent), number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and 
property size to provide an estimated price. By reducing the reliance on traditional, timeconsuming valuation methods, this tool helps buyers, sellers, and investors make more 
informed decisions efficiently.
## 1.2. Objectives: 
#### • Build a predictive model to estimate real estate prices accurately.
#### • Assist buyers and sellers in making data-driven decisions, minimizing financial risks.
#### • Minimize inefficiencies in property valuation.
## 1.3. Scope: 
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices for residential areas within 
selected cities based on available historical data. The prediction engine leverages machine 
learning models Random Forest to generate estimates. While the system provides general 
price predictions, it does not account for sudden market shifts, legal constraints, or 
economic disruptions. The primary users include property buyers, sellers, investors, and 
agents. Future versions of the system could integrate real-time data and expand to cover 
commercial properties and additional cities.

# 2. LITERATURE REVIEW / BACKGROUND 
Today, one of the most significant challenges faced by individuals in the real estate 
sector is accurately determining property prices based on various factors such as location, 
amenities, property features, and market trends. With the real estate market being highly 
dynamic and influenced by numerous economic and geographic variables, traditional 
methods of property valuation often fail to provide precise and timely estimates. This results 
in either undervaluation or overpricing of properties, causing inefficiencies for both buyers 
and sellers.
Additionally, the real estate industry lacks a centralized, data-driven solution. Buyers often 
struggle to make informed decisions, and sellers face challenges in setting the right price, 
leading to prolonged property listings. This problem is further compounded in fast-growing 
urban areas where property prices fluctuate rapidly due to shifting demands.

# 3. METHODOLOGY 
## 3.1. Tools and Technologies Used: 
#### • Programming Language: Python 
#### • Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy 
#### • Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data exploration and visualization) 
#### • Development: Google Collab
#### • Web Framework: Anvil (for frontend and backend integration) 
#### • Deployment: Anvil web app 

## 3.2. Process Flow: 
#### • Data Collection: Gather historical real estate data, including property size, type, location, number of rooms, and rental/sale status. 
#### • Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert categorical variables to numerical format, and normalize data. 
#### • Feature Selection: Select key features like location, property type, bedrooms, bathrooms, and size. 
#### • Model Training: Train models using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest on the preprocessed data. 
#### • Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics like R2 Score or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure accuracy. 
#### • Web Interface Development: Build the frontend using Anvil, allowing users to input property details and view predictions. 
#### • Integration: Connect the prediction model with the Anvil app to provide real-time outputs. 
#### • Testing and Validation: Test the web application to validate input fields and confirm the accuracy of predictions. 
## 3.3. Algorithms/Procedures: 
#### • Pipeline: A Scikit-learn pipeline is used to streamline preprocessing and model training. The pipeline handles feature scaling, encoding, and prediction in one process, ensuring efficient, consistent handling of input data.
#### • Prediction Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor for predicting prices.

# 4. SYSTEM DESIGN / IMPLEMENTATION 
## 4.2. Components / Modules: 
#### User Interface (Frontend):
##### • Allows users to select property details (type, location, rooms, etc.).
##### • Displays the predicted price based on the entered details.
#### Prediction Model:
##### • Machine Learning Model: Random Forest model trained on real estate dataset to provide accurate predictions.
##### • Takes user input and processes it to generate the predicted price.
#### Backend Integration:
##### • Links the frontend interface with the machine learning models to ensure smooth data flow between the user input and the prediction engine.

# 5. CONCLUSION 
The Real Estate Price Prediction project successfully demonstrates how machine 
learning can be utilized to predict property prices based on key features such as property 
type, location, number of rooms, and area. By providing users with a straight forward 
interface, the system allows for easy input of relevant data and generates accurate price 
predictions within seconds. The model simplifies the decision-making process for users, 
whether they are looking to buy, sell, or rent properties. The integration with Anvil ensures a 
seamless user experience, combining both functionality and aesthetics.
 #### Future work or improvement
##### • Expanded Dataset (a larger and more diverse dataset to improve the model’s accuracy and handle more cities or regions.)
##### • Incorporating Additional Features (property age, market trends, amenities)
##### • Real-Time Market Data Integration
##### • Improved Model Performance
